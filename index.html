					<h3>Game Development</h3>
					<p>I've published a couple of games to Google Play in beta (Collide-O-Scope and Testing Your Marbles, now lapsed) and had a hand in a few others through game jams and hackathons - Rope Roll-up, Pitfighter, Calculator Crisis and a driving game where you lean to steer and smile to go faster. I also like to explore possibilities for future games. Here are some video clips to give a flavour of what I've been doing. Enjoy.</p>

Much effort was spent on creating <b>intuitive movement</b> and decent <b>camera behaviour</b>.</p>

							<h3>Game Physics</h3>
							<p>I've tinkered with many refinements and extensions. As an alternative to conventional marbles I created a rolling robot. I was looking for something to visually explain the powered rolling and jumping motion - without putting a running monkey inside. It can tumble about any axis but has a tendency to right itself. A solar panel and energy cells completed the look.</p>

							<h3>Polygon triangulation in C++ and Unreal</h3>
							<p>This was a personal project to triangulate arbitrary polygons drawn in Unreal so that they would <b>simulate physics</b>. Most of the processing is done in <b>C++</b> and <b>Blueprint</b> is used to call the relevant functions.</p>

							<h3>Game Playing AI with C++</h3>
							<p>I am also interested in the use of AI in games. This was a personal project to explore the creation of opponents for 2 player zero-sum games. I made simulations for noughts and crosses, Connect 4 and Mancala and tested a variety of techniques including minimax, <b>alphabeta</b> and hand crafted heuristics.</p>

							<h3>Python Bots</h3>
							<p>Although I enjoy soving puzzles myself, I've also written several python bots to do it for me. These <b>solve puzzles</b> from an online site - sudoku, jigsaw sudoku, inertia, flip and guess (aka mastermind). They use <b>image processing</b> to identify the puzzle, and <b>Python</b> to control the keyboard and mouse to enter the solution. I added a delay to make it possible to view each move.</p>
